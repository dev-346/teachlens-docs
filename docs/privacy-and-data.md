# 🔐 Privacy-First by Design

TeachLens is built with a core commitment to data privacy and security. We believe you should have complete ownership of your classroom data. Here’s how we ensure it:

*   **💻 All Data Stays on Your Computer:** Every piece of information—including student names, assessment questions, and diagnostic results—is stored exclusively on your local device.

*   **☁️ No Cloud Storage:** We do not use any cloud databases or central servers to store your data. Nothing is ever uploaded to us.

*   **👤 No Student Accounts:** Students can join quizzes anonymously without needing to create accounts or provide personal information beyond a name for the session.

*   **📶 Local Network Operation:** Live diagnostic quizzes run entirely over your local Wi-Fi network. Student responses are sent directly from their device to yours, without ever touching the internet.

*   **🔑 You Control the AI:** Because you provide your own Google AI API key, your content is processed through your own account. We do not have access to it.

*   **✅ Full Ownership and Control:** This local-first approach means you retain full ownership and control over all your classroom data, making TeachLens a secure and trustworthy choice for any educational setting.
