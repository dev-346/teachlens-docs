# 📊 Understanding Diagnostic Results

After running a diagnostic quiz, TeachLens provides a powerful, AI-driven analysis of your students' performance. This guide explains how to interpret the results and what actions you can take.

## Step 1: Receive & Analyze Responses

As students submit their quizzes, their responses will appear on the results page in real-time. You'll see a counter showing how many students have completed the quiz.

Once you have a sufficient number of responses, click the **"Analyze Results"** button. The AI will perform a deep analysis of the answers and generate a full diagnostic report.

> **💡 Tip:** If new students submit their responses after you've run the analysis, a "Re-analyze" button will appear, allowing you to update the report with the latest data.

## Step 2: Interpret the Diagnostic Report

> **💡 A Note on AI-Powered Analysis**
> The diagnostic report is powered by AI to give you a quick, insightful overview of your class's learning patterns. Think of it as a skilled teaching assistant working alongside you. It excels at spotting trends and highlighting potential learning gaps that might be difficult to see on your own.
>
> While the AI provides strong, data-driven recommendations, it's designed to complement—not replace—your professional expertise. Use these insights as a starting point, and always combine them with your own knowledge of your students to make the best instructional decisions.

The report is broken down into several key sections:

### 🚦 Teaching Decision & Actions
This is your high-level summary. It's a clear, color-coded recommendation for your next instructional move, with action buttons to generate follow-up materials directly.

*   **🔴 Reteach Required:** Indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the core concepts. The majority of the class struggled significantly.
    *   **Action:** Click **"Generate Reteaching Plan"** to create a data-driven lesson plan targeting the identified gaps. This plan includes key misconceptions, clarification strategies, and suggested activities.

*   **🟡 Practice Required:** Students have a basic grasp of the concepts but are making consistent errors. They need more practice to build fluency.
    *   **Action:** Click **"Generate Adaptive Follow-up Quiz"** to create a new quiz that specifically targets the weak areas and misconceptions identified.

*   **🟠 Review Suggested:** Understanding is uneven. Some students have mastered the material, while others are lagging. A targeted review is recommended before moving on.
    *   **Action:** Click **"Generate Adaptive Follow-up Quiz"** to create a new quiz for the students who need more practice.

*   **🟢 Move On:** The class has demonstrated a strong understanding of the material. You can confidently move on to the next topic.

### 🎯 Primary Learning Concern
This section provides a plain-language explanation of the single biggest conceptual misunderstanding that the AI identified in the class. It answers the question, "What is the *one thing* my students are getting wrong the most?"

### 🔬 Question-by-Question Insights
Here, you'll find a breakdown of each question on the quiz. For each one, you'll see:
*   **Accuracy:** The percentage of students who answered the question correctly.
*   **Common Wrong Answers:** A list of the most frequently chosen incorrect answers, showing you the specific distractors that were most effective.
*   **AI Insight:** A powerful, AI-generated explanation of *why* students may have chosen the incorrect answers. This helps you understand the underlying thought process behind the errors.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Student Grouping
To help you with differentiated instruction, the AI automatically clusters students into groups based on their performance and error patterns. Common groups include:

*   **Concept Rebuild:** Students who need foundational reteaching.
*   **Guided Practice:** Students who would benefit from teacher-led practice.
*   **Monitor:** Students who are on the right track but could use observation.
*   **Enrichment:** Students who have mastered the concept and are ready for a challenge.

You can also switch to a **Table View** to see a sortable list of all students. This view includes each student's score, their AI-generated confidence level, and a **Misconduct** count. This Misconduct metric tracks how many times a student navigated away from the quiz tab, which can be an indicator of distraction or seeking outside help.
