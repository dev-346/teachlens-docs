# 📄 Generating Question Papers

TeachLens allows you to quickly create professional, print-ready question papers for use as worksheets, homework assignments, or in-class tests. This guide focuses on creating a "Standard Assessment."

## ✨ How It Works

When you create a Standard Assessment, you are asking the AI to generate a set of questions based on your criteria. After generation, you can review, edit, and finalize the questions before downloading them as a PDF.

## 📝 Steps to Generate a Paper

1.  **Navigate to New Assessment:** Click on "New Assessment" in the sidebar to open the creation form.
2.  **Select Assessment Type:** Ensure **"Set Question Paper"** (Standard Assessment) is selected.
3.  **Fill out Details:** Provide the grade, subject, and topic for your assessment. The more specific your topic, the better the results will be (e.g., "Solving two-step linear equations" is better than "Algebra").
4.  **Provide Content Source:** You have three options for providing context to the AI:
    *   **✍️ Enter Topic:** Provide a key topic or skill.
    *   **📋 Paste Lesson Text:** Paste content from your lesson plan for the AI to use as context.
    *   **📂 Upload File:** Upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file for the AI to analyze.
5.  **Configure Questions:** Specify the number of questions for each type (e.g., 5 MCQs, 2 Short Answer).
6.  **🚀 Generate:** Click the **"Generate Questions"** button. The AI will create your assessment and take you to the "Edit Assessment" screen.
7.  **Review and Download:** On the "Edit Assessment" screen, you can make changes to any question. Once you're satisfied, click the **"Download PDFs"** button to save the question paper and a worksheet version to your computer.

## 🗃️ Finding Your Papers Later

All assessments you create are automatically saved in your **Test Bank**, which you can access from the sidebar. From the Test Bank, you can open, edit, or re-download any of your past question papers.
